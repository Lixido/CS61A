CS61A Project 4: Scheme Interpreter
=======
Instructions: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/proj/scheme/

### Introduction
In this project, you will develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. As you proceed, think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language; many quirks of languages are byproducts of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. The subset of the language used in this project is described in the functional programming section of Composing Programs. Since we only include a subset of the language, your interpreter will not exactly match the behavior of other interpreters.  

You will also implement some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language. You should find that much of what you have learned about Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to other programming languages.

### Knowledge Used
* Scheme programming
* How interpreters work
* Tail recursion
