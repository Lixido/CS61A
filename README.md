# CS61A
Self-study of Berkley course CS61A--structure and interpretation of computer programs in python

### Materials
Based on: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/  
Thanks a lot to other CS61A projects on GitHub

### Things I did:
* Lecture notes: Very elaborate I think
* Homeworks: Mind-boggling sometimes
* Projects: Also mind-boggling
* Examinations: Graded by myself XD
